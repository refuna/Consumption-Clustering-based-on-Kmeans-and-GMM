# Consumption-Clustering-based-on-Kmeans-and-GMM


This project performs clustering on consumption data using k-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models and visualizes the results after using principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. It includes helper functions to draw trust regions for the Gaussian components, highlighting each clusterâ€™s distribution and orientation using ellipses.
